  title: Collaborative RLVR for Robust Reasoning
  domain: reinforcement_learning
  hypothesis: "Making reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) collaborative\u2014\
    by having two models solve mathematical reasoning tasks independently and then\
    \ discuss before answering\u2014will force reasoning to be externalized, challenged,\
    \ and defended, resulting in more robust and faithful reasoning compared to standard\
    \ RLVR, which is prone to brittle behavior and exploitation of dataset patterns.\n"
  background:
    description: 'Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards is a powerful way
      to train LLMs for mathematical reasoning, but it often produces brittle behavior:
      models exploit dataset patterns, generate unfaithful reasoning, and fail under
      simple rephrasings or distribution shifts. The idea is that by making RLVR collaborative
      - i.e. having two models solve independently and then discuss before answering,
      we force reasoning to be externalized/challenged/defended, while keeping rewards
      strictly correctness-based. If a solution has to convince another agent with
      a different inductive bias, shallow heuristics should break, while genuinely
      robust reasoning survives.'
